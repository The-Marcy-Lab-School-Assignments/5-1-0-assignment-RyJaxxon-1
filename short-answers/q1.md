# Question

What is the difference between how instance methods/properties and class methods/properties are created? What is the difference between how they are used?

# Answer

Instance methods are any method we add to our class without anything in front of it, think of it just as a normal function we add to the class.
A class method (also known as a static method) is one specifically meant to be accessed **only by the class itself**. It is differentiated from a regular class method by the keyword `static` being placed in front.

Yup! Instance methods can only be called through an instance, and class methods are called with the class itself!
